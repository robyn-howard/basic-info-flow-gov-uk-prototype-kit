            <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Entitlement</h2>
            <p class="govuk-body">
              Parental leave is unpaid. You’re entitled to 18 weeks’ leave for
              each child and adopted child, up to their 18th birthday.
            </p>
            <p class="govuk-body">
              The limit on how much parental leave each parent can take in a
              year is 4 weeks for each child (unless the employer agrees
              otherwise).
            </p>
            <p class="govuk-body">
              You must take parental leave as whole weeks (for example 1 week or
              2 weeks) rather than individual days, unless your employer agrees
              otherwise or if your child is disabled. You do not have to take
              all the leave at once.
            </p>
            <p class="govuk-body">
              A ‘week’ equals the length of time an employee normally works over
              7 days
            </p>
            <div class="govuk-inset-text">
              <p>Example</p>
              <p>
                If an employee works 3 days a week, one ‘week’ of parental leave
                equals 3 days. If an employee works irregular weeks the number
                of days in a ‘week’ is the total number of days they work a year
                divided by 52.

              <p>Example</p>

                An employee is entitled to 18 weeks. They’ve used 10 with a
                previous employer. They can use up to 8 weeks with their new

              <li>
                they’re not a foster parent (unless they’ve secured parental

              Employers can ask for proof (like a birth certificate) as long as
              it’s reasonable to do so - for example they cannot ask for proof
              each time an employee requests leave.
            </p>
            <p class="govuk-body">
              Employers can choose to offer parental leave to those groups who
              are not eligible. Employees can check this in their staff
              handbook.
            </p>
            <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Notice period</h2>
            <p class="govuk-body">
              Employees must give 21 days’ notice before their intended start
              date. If they or their partner are having a baby or adopting, it’s
              21 days before the week the baby or child is expected.
            </p>
            <p class="govuk-body">
              Employees must confirm the start and end dates in their notice.
              Unless an employer requests it, this does not have to be in
              writing.

                it means an employee would no longer qualify for parental leave,
